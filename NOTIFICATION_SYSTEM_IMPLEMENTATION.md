# Database Notification System Implementation

## Overview

Implemented a complete database notification system for the Budlite application with real-time notifications, dropdown UI, and welcome notifications for new users.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Setup

-   ✅ Created `notifications` table migration using `php artisan notifications:table`
-   ✅ Ran migration successfully: `php artisan migrate --path=database/migrations/2025_11_23_173859_create_notifications_table.php`

### 2. Notification Class

-   ✅ Updated `WelcomeNotification` class (`app/Notifications/WelcomeNotification.php`)
    -   Added `database` channel to `via()` method
    -   Updated `toArray()` method to return notification data with:
        -   `title`: "Welcome to Budlite! 🎉"
        -   `message`: "Your account has been created successfully..."
        -   `action_url`: Link to dashboard
        -   `action_text`: "Go to Dashboard"
        -   `type`: "welcome"

### 3. Controller

-   ✅ Updated `NotificationController` (`app/Http/Controllers/Tenant/NotificationController.php`)
    -   `index()`: Get all notifications with pagination
    -   `getUnreadCount()`: Get count of unread notifications
    -   `markAsRead($id)`: Mark single notification as read
    -   `markAllAsRead()`: Mark all notifications as read
    -   `destroy($id)`: Delete notification

### 4. Routes

-   ✅ Added notification routes in `routes/tenant.php`:
    ```php
    Route::prefix('notifications')->name('tenant.notifications.')->group(function () {
        Route::get('/', [NotificationController::class, 'index'])->name('index');
        Route::get('/unread-count', [NotificationController::class, 'unread-count'])->name('unread-count');
        Route::post('/{id}/mark-read', [NotificationController::class, 'mark-read'])->name('mark-read');
        Route::post('/mark-all-read', [NotificationController::class, 'mark-all-read'])->name('mark-all-read');
        Route::delete('/{id}', [NotificationController::class, 'destroy'])->name('destroy');
    });
    ```

### 5. Header UI Update

-   ✅ Replaced dummy notification button with functional dropdown in `resources/views/layouts/tenant/header.blade.php`
    -   Shows unread count badge (red circle with number)
    -   Dropdown with latest 5 notifications
    -   Click to mark as read
    -   "Mark all read" button
    -   "View all notifications" link
    -   Real-time data fetching using Alpine.js
    -   Visual indicators for unread notifications (blue background)

### 6. Notifications Page

-   ✅ Created full notifications page (`resources/views/tenant/notifications/index.blade.php`)
    -   Lists all notifications with pagination
    -   Mark individual notifications as read
    -   Mark all as read button
    -   Delete individual notifications
    -   Shows notification icon, title, message, timestamp
    -   Action buttons for each notification
    -   Empty state when no notifications

### 7. Integration with Registration

-   ✅ Updated `AuthController` register method to send welcome notification
    -   Imports `WelcomeNotification` class
    -   Sends notification after user creation: `$user->notify(new WelcomeNotification($verificationCode))`

## How It Works

### User Registration Flow

1. User registers → `AuthController::register()`
2. User account created in database
3. `WelcomeNotification` sent to user
4. Notification stored in `notifications` table
5. User sees notification badge in header
6. User can click to view notification dropdown
7. User can mark as read or delete

### Notification Display

-   **Header Badge**: Shows unread count (e.g., "3")
-   **Dropdown**: Shows latest 5 notifications
-   **Full Page**: Shows all notifications with pagination

### Notification Data Structure

```json
{
    "title": "Welcome to Budlite! 🎉",
    "message": "Your account has been created successfully. Start managing your business with ease.",
    "action_url": "https://example.com/tenant/dashboard",
    "action_text": "Go to Dashboard",
    "type": "welcome"
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Sending a Notification

```php
use App\Notifications\WelcomeNotification;

// Send to a user
$user->notify(new WelcomeNotification($verificationCode));

// Send to multiple users
Notification::send($users, new WelcomeNotification($verificationCode));
```

### Creating New Notification Types

1. Create notification class: `php artisan make:notification InvoiceCreatedNotification`
2. Add `database` to `via()` method
3. Update `toArray()` method with notification data
4. Send notification: `$user->notify(new InvoiceCreatedNotification($invoice))`

### Example: Invoice Created Notification

```php
// app/Notifications/InvoiceCreatedNotification.php
public function via($notifiable)
{
    return ['database'];
}

public function toArray($notifiable)
{
    return [
        'title' => 'New Invoice Created',
        'message' => "Invoice #{$this->invoice->invoice_number} has been created for {$this->invoice->customer->name}",
        'action_url' => route('tenant.accounting.invoices.show', ['tenant' => tenant()->slug, 'invoice' => $this->invoice->id]),
        'action_text' => 'View Invoice',
        'type' => 'invoice_created',
    ];
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Suggested Notification Types

1. **Invoice Notifications**

    - Invoice created
    - Invoice paid
    - Invoice overdue
    - Payment received

2. **Payroll Notifications**

    - Payroll processed
    - Payslip generated
    - Salary paid

3. **Inventory Notifications**

    - Low stock alert
    - Stock received
    - Stock adjustment

4. **System Notifications**
    - Subscription expiring
    - Backup completed
    - User added to team

### Additional Features to Consider

-   [ ] Email notifications (already supported via `mail` channel)
-   [ ] Push notifications (browser notifications)
-   [ ] SMS notifications (via Twilio)
-   [ ] Notification preferences (user can choose which notifications to receive)
-   [ ] Notification categories/filters
-   [ ] Notification search
-   [ ] Bulk delete notifications
-   [ ] Auto-delete old notifications (e.g., after 30 days)

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. Register a new user account
2. Check header for notification badge (should show "1")
3. Click notification bell icon
4. See welcome notification in dropdown
5. Click notification to mark as read
6. Badge count should decrease
7. Visit `/notifications` page to see all notifications
8. Test "Mark all as read" button
9. Test delete notification button

### Database Check

```sql
-- Check notifications table
SELECT * FROM notifications WHERE notifiable_id = [USER_ID];

-- Check unread notifications
SELECT * FROM notifications WHERE notifiable_id = [USER_ID] AND read_at IS NULL;
```

## Notes

-   Notifications are stored in the `notifications` table
-   Each notification is linked to a user via `notifiable_id` and `notifiable_type`
-   Unread notifications have `read_at = NULL`
-   Read notifications have a timestamp in `read_at`
-   Notifications can be deleted permanently
-   The system uses Laravel's built-in notification system
-   Alpine.js is used for reactive UI in the header dropdown
