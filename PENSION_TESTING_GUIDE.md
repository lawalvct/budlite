    pr.pension_employee,
    pr.pension_employer,
    (pr.pension_employee + pr.pension_employer) as total_pension
FROM payroll_runs pr
JOIN employees e ON pr.employee_id = e.id
WHERE pr.payroll_period_id = YOUR_PERIOD_ID;
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Pension Not Calculated

**Symptoms**: Pension shows ₦0.00 for all employees

**Solutions**:

1. Check if `pension_exempt` is set to `true` (should be `false`)
2. Verify basic salary is set for employee
3. Regenerate payroll after fixing employee data

### Issue 2: Wrong Pension Amount

**Symptoms**: Pension amount doesn't match 8% + 10%

**Solutions**:

1. Verify basic salary amount
2. Check calculation:
    - Employee: Basic Salary × 0.08
    - Employer: Basic Salary × 0.10
3. Clear cache: `php artisan optimize:clear`

### Issue 3: Employee Not Showing in Report

**Symptoms**: Employee missing from pension report

**Solutions**:

1. Check if employee has `pension_exempt = true`
2. Verify payroll was generated for that period
3. Check date range filter in report

### Issue 4: PFA Provider Not Grouping

**Symptoms**: Employees not grouped by PFA in report

**Solutions**:

1. Ensure `pfa_provider` field is filled for employees
2. Check spelling consistency (e.g., "ARM Pension" vs "ARM pension")
3. Empty PFA providers will be grouped under "Not Assigned"

## Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Basic Calculation

```
Basic Salary: ₦500,000

Employee Contribution (8%):
₦500,000 × 0.08 = ₦40,000

Employer Contribution (10%):
₦500,000 × 0.10 = ₦50,000

Total Pension:
₦40,000 + ₦50,000 = ₦90,000
```

### Example 2: Multiple Employees

```
Employee A: ₦300,000 basic
- Employee: ₦24,000
- Employer: ₦30,000
- Total: ₦54,000

Employee B: ₦450,000 basic
- Employee: ₦36,000
- Employer: ₦45,000
- Total: ₦81,000

Grand Total:
