## Technical Implementation

### Database Queries

All reports use efficient SQL queries with proper indexing:

-   Sales data filtered by `voucher_type.inventory_effect = 'decrease'`
-   Only `posted` vouchers are included
-   Date filtering on `voucher_date`
-   Proper joins with ledger accounts and products

### Performance Optimization

-   **Caching:** Report data can be cached for frequently accessed reports
-   **Pagination:** Large datasets paginated (20 items per page)
-   **Eager Loading:** Relationships preloaded to avoid N+1 queries
-   **Aggregations:** Database-level aggregations for better performance

### Data Sources

1. **Vouchers Table:** Invoice header information
2. **Invoice Items Table:** Line-level product sales data
3. **Voucher Entries Table:** Accounting entries for customer identification
4. **Ledger Accounts Table:** Customer/vendor information
5. **Products Table:** Product details, costs, and pricing
6. **Product Categories Table:** Category classification

## Key Metrics Explained

### Total Sales

Sum of all posted sales invoices within the date range, excluding drafts and cancelled invoices.

### Average Sale Value

Total sales divided by number of invoices. Indicates transaction size.

### Collection Rate

Percentage of sales that have been paid. Calculated from receipt vouchers linked to invoices.

### Gross Profit

Revenue minus cost of goods sold (COGS). Uses purchase rates from invoice items.

### Profit Margin

Gross profit as a percentage of revenue: `(Gross Profit / Revenue) × 100`

### Growth Rate

Percentage change from comparison period: `((Current - Previous) / Previous) × 100`
