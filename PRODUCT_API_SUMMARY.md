## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Auto-Generation**

    - SKU is auto-generated if not provided
    - Slug is auto-generated from product name

2. **Stock Tracking**

    - Set `maintain_stock: true` for items
    - Set `maintain_stock: false` for services
    - Opening stock creates a stock movement

3. **Deletion Rules**

    - Products with stock movements cannot be deleted
    - Use deactivate instead for products with history

4. **Validation**
    - All numeric fields must be >= 0
    - Required fields: type, name, purchase_rate, sales_rate, primary_unit_id
    - SKU must be unique per tenant
