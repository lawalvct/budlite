## 📦 Dependencies

All required dependencies are already installed:

-   Laravel Framework 10.x
-   Barryvdh/Laravel-DomPDF
-   Laravel Mail

## 🎯 Business Rules

1. **Draft Status:**

    - Can be edited
    - Can be deleted
    - Can be sent
    - Cannot be converted

2. **Sent Status:**

    - Cannot be edited
    - Cannot be deleted
    - Can be accepted
    - Can be rejected
    - Can be converted (if accepted)

3. **Accepted Status:**

    - Cannot be edited
    - Cannot be deleted
    - Can be converted to invoice

4. **Rejected Status:**

    - Cannot be edited
    - Cannot be deleted
    - Cannot be converted
    - Requires rejection reason

5. **Converted Status:**

    - Cannot be edited
    - Cannot be deleted
    - Cannot be converted again
    - Links to created invoice

6. **Expired Status:**
    - Automatically set when expiry_date passes
    - Cannot be converted
    - Can be duplicated

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

1. **Separate from Vouchers:** Quotations are separate entities until converted
2. **No Accounting Impact:** Quotations don't affect ledgers until converted
3. **Snapshot Data:** Product names/prices captured at quotation time
4. **Bidirectional Links:** Both quotation→invoice and invoice→quotation links
5. **Status Validation:** Strict rules on what can be done in each status
6. **Audit Trail:** Complete tracking of who did what and when
7. **Soft Deletes:** Deleted quotations retained for audit purposes

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

-   Indexed frequently queried columns
-   Eager loading relationships
-   Pagination on list views
-   Efficient query scopes
-   Cached calculations

## 🌐 Multi-Tenant Support

-   All queries automatically scoped to tenant
-   Quotation numbers unique per tenant
-   Tenant isolation enforced at database level
-   No cross-tenant data leakage possible
