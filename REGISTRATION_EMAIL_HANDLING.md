# Registration Email Handling - Fix Documentation

## Problem

When registration failed due to email sending errors (SMTP connection issues), the user and tenant records were still being saved to the database, leading to:

-   Orphaned database records
-   Users unable to complete registration
-   Confusion about account status

## Error Example

```
Connection could not be established with host "sandbox.smtp.mailtrap.io:2525":
stream_socket_client(): php_network_getaddresses: getaddrinfo for sandbox.smtp.mailtrap.io failed
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Transaction Rollback on Email Failure

-   **Location**: `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/RegisteredUserController.php`
-   **Change**: Email sending is now wrapped in try-catch inside the DB transaction
-   **Result**: If email fails, ALL database changes are rolled back:
    -   Tenant record not created
    -   User record not created
    -   Verification code not stored
    -   User not logged in

### 2. User-Friendly Error Messages

-   **Email-specific errors**: Clear message about email sending failure
-   **Generic errors**: Standard "try again" message
-   **Form data preservation**: User input is preserved (except passwords)

### 3. Code Changes

```php
// Before: Email failure didn't rollback transaction
$user->notify(new WelcomeNotification($code));

// After: Email failure triggers transaction rollback
try {
    $user->notify(new WelcomeNotification($code));
    Log::info('Welcome email sent successfully', ['user_id' => $user->id]);
} catch (\Exception $emailError) {
    Log::error('Email sending failed', [
        'user_id' => $user->id,
        'error' => $emailError->getMessage()
    ]);

    // Throw exception to trigger transaction rollback
    throw new \Exception('Failed to send verification email. Please check your internet connection and try again.');
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Success Flow

1. User submits registration form
2. Validation passes
3. DB transaction begins
4. Tenant created
5. Trial started
6. User created
7. Verification code generated
8. **Email sent successfully** ✅
9. User logged in
10. Transaction committed
11. Redirect to verification page

### Failure Flow (Email Error)

1. User submits registration form
2. Validation passes
3. DB transaction begins
4. Tenant created
5. Trial started
6. User created
7. Verification code generated
8. **Email sending fails** ❌
9. Exception thrown
10. **Transaction rolled back** (all records deleted)
11. User returned to form with error message
12. Form data preserved (can try again immediately)

## Error Messages

### Email-Related Errors

Shows when error contains keywords: `verification email`, `smtp`, `mailtrap`, `Connection could not be established`

**Message**:

```
Unable to send verification email. Please check your internet connection and try again.
If the problem persists, contact support.
```

### Generic Errors

**Message**:

```
Registration failed. Please try again.
```

## Benefits

✅ **Data Integrity**: No orphaned records in database
✅ **User Experience**: Clear error messages, can retry immediately
✅ **Debugging**: Detailed logs for troubleshooting
✅ **Form Preservation**: User doesn't lose their input
✅ **Security**: Passwords never preserved in form data

## Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: SMTP Server Down

-   **Setup**: Disable internet or use invalid SMTP credentials
-   **Expected**: Registration fails, no records in DB, error message shown
-   **Result**: ✅ Pass

### Test 2: Valid Registration

-   **Setup**: Valid SMTP settings, all inputs correct
-   **Expected**: Registration succeeds, email sent, user logged in
-   **Result**: ✅ Pass

### Test 3: Database Error

-   **Setup**: Simulate DB constraint violation
-   **Expected**: Registration fails, no email sent, error message shown
-   **Result**: ✅ Pass

## Configuration Files to Check

If email is still failing, check these files:

1. **`.env`** - Mail configuration

```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=sandbox.smtp.mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_USERNAME=your_username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="noreply@budlite.ngm"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

2. **`config/mail.php`** - Mail service configuration

## Alternative: Queue-Based Email (Future Enhancement)

For production, consider moving email to queue:

```php
// Instead of synchronous sending
$user->notify(new WelcomeNotification($code));

// Use queued notification
dispatch(function() use ($user, $code) {
    $user->notify(new WelcomeNotification($code));
})->afterCommit();
```

**Benefits**:

-   Registration completes faster
-   Email failures don't block registration
-   Automatic retry on failure

**Tradeoffs**:

-   User might not receive email immediately
-   Need queue worker running
-   More complex error handling

## Monitoring

Check logs for registration issues:

```bash
# View recent registration attempts
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep "Registration"

# Check for email failures
grep "Email sending failed" storage/logs/laravel.log

# Monitor SMTP errors
grep "smtp\|mailtrap" storage/logs/laravel.log
```

## Support Workflow

When user reports "registration not working":

1. Check if it's email-related (ask about error message)
2. Verify SMTP settings in `.env`
3. Check logs: `storage/logs/laravel.log`
4. Test email manually: `php artisan tinker` → `Mail::raw('Test', function($m) { $m->to('test@test.com')->subject('Test'); });`
5. If SMTP issue persists, consider alternative email provider

## Developer Notes

-   Email sending MUST be inside transaction for rollback to work
-   Always log both success and failure cases
-   Preserve user input (except sensitive data) on error
-   Use specific error messages for better UX
