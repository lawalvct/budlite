## 📋 What's Stored in the Database

When payroll is generated, the system creates records in:

### **`payroll_run_details` table:**

Each earning and deduction component creates ONE row:

| id  | payroll_run_id | salary_component_id | component_name      | component_type | amount | is_taxable |
| --- | -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | -------------- | ------ | ---------- |
| 1   | 101            | 5                   | Housing Allowance   | earning        | 50000  | 1          |
| 2   | 101            | 6                   | Transport Allowance | earning        | 30000  | 1          |
| 3   | 101            | 7                   | Meal Allowance      | earning        | 20000  | 1          |
| 4   | 101            | 10                  | Pension (Employee)  | deduction      | 16000  | 0          |
| 5   | 101            | 11                  | Loan Repayment      | deduction      | 20000  | 0          |

This is a **snapshot** of components at the time payroll was generated, so even if you change component amounts later, historical payslips remain accurate.

## 🔍 How to Verify Components Are Working

### **Test 1: Check Calculation**

1. Create employee with Basic Salary: ₦100,000
2. Assign Housing Allowance (Fixed ₦50,000)
3. Generate payroll
4. Open payslip
5. **Expected:** Gross Salary = ₦150,000 (₦100,000 + ₦50,000)

### **Test 2: Check Percentage Calculation**

1. Create employee with Basic Salary: ₦200,000
2. Assign Meal Allowance (10% percentage)
3. Generate payroll
4. Open payslip
5. **Expected:** Meal Allowance shows ₦20,000 (10% of ₦200,000)

### **Test 3: Check Multiple Components**

1. Create employee with Basic Salary: ₦300,000
2. Assign:
    - Housing: ₦50,000 (fixed)
    - Transport: ₦30,000 (fixed)
    - Bonus: 5% (percentage = ₦15,000)
    - Pension: 8% (deduction = ₦24,000)
3. Generate payroll
4. Open payslip
5. **Expected:**
    - Gross: ₦395,000 (₦300k + ₦50k + ₦30k + ₦15k)
    - After Pension: ₦371,000 (₦395k - ₦24k)

## 🚨 Common Issues

### **Issue 1: Components Not Showing on Payslip**

**Possible Causes:**

-   Components were created but not assigned to employee
-   Payroll was generated before components were assigned
-   Component status is inactive

**Solution:**

1. Go to Employees → Edit → Check "Salary Components" section
2. Ensure components are checked/selected
3. Save employee
4. Re-generate payroll period (if already generated)

---

### **Issue 2: Wrong Amounts Calculated**

**Possible Causes:**

-   Calculation type mismatch (fixed vs percentage)
-   Basic salary not set correctly
-   Component value entered wrong

**Solution:**

1. Go to Salary Components → Find the component
2. Verify:
    - Calculation Type: Fixed or Percentage?
    - Value: Is it correct?
    - Is Taxable: Set correctly?
3. Edit if needed
4. Re-generate payroll

---

### **Issue 3: Old Components Still Showing**

**Explanation:** This is by design! Once payroll is generated, it creates a snapshot in `payroll_run_details` table. This preserves historical accuracy.

**To Update:**

1. Edit components or assignments
2. Create NEW payroll period
3. Generate fresh payroll
4. New period will use updated values

3. ✅ Period summary (as totals)
4. ✅ Database records (payroll_run_details table)

**The key is:**

1. Create components → Assign to employees → Generate payroll → View payslip
2. Components show ONLY AFTER payroll is generated
3. Each employee's payslip shows ONLY components assigned to them

## 🆘 Need Help?

If components still don't show:

1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Check Laravel logs: `storage/logs/laravel.log`
3. Verify database: `SELECT * FROM payroll_run_details WHERE payroll_run_id = [your_run_id]`
4. Clear cache: `php artisan optimize:clear`
